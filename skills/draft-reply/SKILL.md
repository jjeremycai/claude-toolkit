# draft-reply

This skill provides patterns and best practices for drafting email replies in Missive. It should be used when Claude is asked to "draft a reply", "write an email response", "compose a reply", "help me respond to this email", or is working with the Missive draft assistant agent.

## Core Principles

### Brevity First
Keep drafts concise. Most emails can be answered in 2-4 sentences. Respect the recipient's time.

### Match the Context
- **Formal contexts** (new contacts, business inquiries, complaints): Professional tone, complete sentences, proper salutations
- **Casual contexts** (ongoing threads, colleagues, known contacts): Conversational tone, can skip formalities
- **Quick acknowledgments**: One-liner is fine ("Got it, thanks!" or "Will do.")

### Structure for Clarity
For longer responses:
1. **Acknowledge** - Reference what they said/asked
2. **Answer** - Address their main point directly
3. **Action** - State next steps or what you need from them

## Drafting Workflow

### Before Writing
1. Read the full conversation thread for context
2. Identify the sender and your relationship (new contact vs ongoing thread)
3. Note any specific questions that need answering
4. Check if there are attachments or links referenced

### Writing the Draft
1. Start with appropriate greeting (or skip if mid-thread)
2. Address the most important point first
3. Use line breaks between distinct topics
4. End with clear next steps or sign-off

### After Drafting
- Draft is created for user review, NOT sent
- User will edit tone/details as needed
- Include any notes about things you couldn't determine

## Email Patterns

### Responding to Questions
```
[Answer the question directly]

[Any necessary context or caveats]

[Offer to clarify if needed]
```

### Responding to Requests
```
[Confirm you can/will do it, or explain why not]

[Timeline or next steps]

[Any info you need from them]
```

### Following Up
```
[Reference previous conversation]

[State the update or reminder]

[Clear ask or next step]
```

### Declining/Saying No
```
[Thank them for reaching out/thinking of you]

[Clear but kind decline]

[Alternative if possible]
```

## What to Skip

When drafting, DO NOT respond to:
- **Newsletters/marketing** - No reply needed
- **Automated notifications** - System-generated, no human to reply to
- **Spam** - Obviously skip
- **CC'd emails** where you're not the primary recipient and no action is needed
- **FYI/informational** emails that explicitly say "no reply needed"

---

## Tone Guidelines

### Professional but Human
- Avoid corporate jargon ("per my last email", "circle back", "synergize")
- Use contractions naturally ("I'll" not "I will")
- Be direct without being curt

### Matching Energy
- If they wrote casually, you can too
- If they wrote formally, match that level
- When in doubt, err slightly more formal

### Signoffs
- **Formal**: "Best regards," "Thank you,"
- **Neutral**: "Best," "Thanks,"
- **Casual**: "Thanks!" "Cheers," or just your name
- **Quick thread**: Can skip signoff entirely
